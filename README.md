Safe haven for my ideas and more.
# Hi there, I'm Ayanda!

I'm a **Web Programming 261 student** with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites.I have experience with certain programming languages, such as:

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books, hiking in the mountains, or playing board games with friends. I'm a big fan of **Game of Thrones**, **Harry Potter**, and **Star Wars**. 

Here's one of my favorite quotes by Albert Einstein to inspire you:
> "Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."
